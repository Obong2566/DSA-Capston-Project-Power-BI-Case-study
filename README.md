# DSA-Capston-Project-Power-BI-Case-study
   My second project on Data Analysis

## Project Overview
   This is the Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company based in Nigeria, is embroiled in issues
bordering on gender inequality in its 3 regions.Unfortunately, the media recently
published the news with the headline “Palmoria, the Manufacturing Patriarchy”. This
doesn’t look good for the owners of the business, based on their ambition to scale the
business to other regions and even overseas. Cases like this can only spiral downwards,
revealing other issues like the gender pay gap, amongst other possible issues. I have been recruited by Mr Shofoluwe(CHRO) as an HR Analytics expert to analyse the company’s
HR data and come up with recommendations for management’s attention.
